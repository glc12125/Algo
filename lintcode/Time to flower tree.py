'''
There is a tree of nn nodes with Num.00 to n-1nâˆ’1, where node 00 is the root node and the parent node of node ii is father[i]father[i]. Now to water the tree, sprinkle water on the root node, the water will flow down every edge, from the father of node ii to node ii costs time[i]time[i], how long will it take to flow water to all nodes?
